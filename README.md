# Mars Rover Image Fetcher
## By Satvik Mishra, S1 CSE-AI B
### Program Overview

The main screen appears when the program is run and is used to fetch images. After entering parameters such as selecting a rover, camera, and earth date, the user only needs to click the "Fetch Images" button, and the images will be downloaded. After clicking the "Fetch Images" button, the images will be loaded into another tab where the user has the option to navigate to the next image, the previous image, and send the images to one or multiple email addresses. The user interface also allows the user to write the email's subject and body. A confirmation notification will shortly appear after clicking "Send Emails" to confirm that the emails have been sent.

The program will display an error window if:

1. The parameters entered are incorrect or the API is not functioning at the moment.
2. The email addresses entered are incorrect.
